A Modular, Agentic AI Framework for Truth-Oriented Research and Autonomous Knowledge Discovery

    “Not just information retrieval — but unconcealment of truth.”
Aletheia is a cutting-edge AI research agent that fuses tool-augmented LLMs, semantic reasoning, and structured prompt engineering to autonomously explore, retrieve, and synthesize high-fidelity knowledge. It leverages the LangChain ecosystem alongside Pydantic for schema integrity and autonomous agentic control to act as an intelligent co-researcher capable of epistemic alignment with user queries.

🔍 What It Does

    🧠 Agentic Reasoning: Employs large language models as planners within a chain-of-thought framework

    🌐 Web-Augmented Knowledge: Uses real-time search via DuckDuckGo to enrich responses

    🧰 Tool Integration: Dynamically routes tasks to modular tools for precision task completion

    🧾 Structured I/O: Enforces correctness and safety using Pydantic schemas

    🧩 Composable Architecture: Built for plug-and-play extensibility with future tools, vector DBs, and memory systems
